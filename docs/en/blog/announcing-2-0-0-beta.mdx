Extension.js is now officially in beta.

**Version 2.0.0-beta**

- Fixed SASS Modules not working in the content script.
- Add support to Svelte templates.
- Add preview command.
- Updated documentation (this one!)

The beta release is focused on making all the existing features stable enough to document and test. New features are locked until the next stable release and the documentation is now up-to-date. This is the last beta release before the release candidate.

Thanks for reading. Talk soon.
