The `dev` command watches for changes in your extension's files, recompiles them, and reloads the extension in real time. If you provide a URL, Extension.js will download and run the extension as if it were local.

## How it Works?

For development frameworks, it's an industry-standard practice to have a development server that watches for changes in your files and recompiles them in real-time. Given the complex nature of browser extensions, the `dev` command in Extension.js handles the watch and recompile process for all the different contexts (HTML or not) of your extension.

The `dev` command also provides a way to run remote extensions by providing a URL. This is useful when you want to test an extension from source without having to clone the repository.

## Usage

You can run the `dev` command with the following syntax:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
  }}
/>

## Arguments and Flags

Below is a breakdown of the available flags for the `dev` command:

| Flag          | Argument                                       | What it does                                                                                                                                            | Defaults to     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [path or url] | The extension path or the remote extension URL | If a path is defined, it loads the local extension. If a URL is provided, it pulls the extension from a remote source and loads it as a local extension | `process.cwd()` |
| -b, --browser | The browser that will run the extension        | Changes the browser (`chrome`, `edge`, `firefox`, `all`)                                                                                                           | `"chrome"`      |
| --chromium-binary | The path to the Chromium binary | The path to the Chromium binary. This is useful when you want to run the extension with Chromium-based browsers not supported by Extension.js. | `undefined` |
| --gecko-binary | The path to the Gecko binary | The path to the Gecko binary. This is useful when you want to run the extension with Firefox-based browsers not supported by Extension.js. | `undefined` |
| -o, --open    | True or false                                  | Opens the browser when the extension is ready                                                                                                           | `true`          |
| --polyfill    | True or false     | Allow the `browser.*` API namespace to run with all Chromium-based browsers**.** | False |                                                                                           | `false`         |

## Examples

### Running a Local Extension

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev ./my-extension",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev ./my-extension",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev ./my-extension",
  }}
/>

### Running a Remote Extension

  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev https://example.com/my-extension",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev https://example.com/my-extension",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev https://example.com/my-extension",
  }}
/>

### Running in Firefox

    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --browser firefox",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --browser firefox",
  }}  
/>

### Running in All Browsers at Once

    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --browser all",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --browser all",
  }}
/>

### Running in Brave as a Custom Binary

![Demo Video](https://placehold.co/600x400)

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --gecko-binary /path/to/brave",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --gecko-binary /path/to/brave",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev ./my-extension --gecko-binary /path/to/brave",
  }}
/>

## Best Practices

- **Browser Specific Configurations:** You can use the `--browser` flag to run your extension in different browsers during the development process.
- **Remote Extensions:** Test them with the `--browser` flag to test your extension in different browsers without having to clone the repository.

## Next Steps

- Once development is complete, it's time to [build your extension](/docs/commands/build).
- Learn how to create features specific to a browser with the [browser-specific manifest fields](/docs/features/browser-fields).
- For advanced browser usage, use the [extension.config.js](/docs/configuration) file to set up browser flags, preferences, and more.
