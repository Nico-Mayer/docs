# Dev Command

The `dev` command in Extension.js is responsible for running your extension in development mode.
This command will start a new browser instance with your extension bundled and ready to run,
while also enabling live-reload as you modify the extension files during development.

## Usage

You can run the `dev` command with the following syntax:

<PackageManagerTabs
  command={{
    npm: "npx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
    pnpm: "pnpx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
    yarn: "yarn dlx extension@latest dev [extension-path | extension-url] [options]",
  }}
/>

## Description

The `dev` command is essential for a fast development workflow. It watches for changes in your extension's files,
recompiles them, and reloads the extension in real time. If you provide a URL, Extension.js will download and run the extension as if it were local.

It supports multiple browsers, and you can specify which one to use by passing the `--browser` flag.
Setting the `browser` to `"all"` will open the extension in all available browsers.
If a browser is not installed, the command will throw a compiler error.

## Arguments and Flags

Below is a breakdown of the available flags for the `dev` command:

| Flag          | Argument                                       | What it does                                                                                                                                            | Defaults to     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [path or url] | The extension path or the remote extension URL | If a path is defined, it loads the local extension. If a URL is provided, it pulls the extension from a remote source and loads it as a local extension | `process.cwd()` |
| -b, --browser | The browser that will run the extension        | Changes the browser (`chrome`, `edge`, `all`)                                                                                                           | `"chrome"`      |

## Best Practices

- **Browser Specific Configurations:** You can use the `--browser` flag to run your extension in different browsers during the development process.
