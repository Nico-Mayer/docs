# Page Reload and Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

**Extension.js** provides powerful reloading capabilities during development, ensuring that code updates are automatically applied without needing to manually refresh the extension.

Extension.js enables HMR for JavaScript and CSS files, while automatically handling more complex reloading scenarios for files like the `manifest.json`, `service_worker.js`, and locale files. This system helps maintain a fast development experience by avoiding manual reloading where possible.

Below is an overview of how different parts of the extension are reloaded:

## How Does It Work?

The reloading behavior in Extension.js is designed to provide a great development experience by automatically updating the extension when changes are detected. The following features are supported:

### Hot Reloaded Features

Most parts of your extension can be hot-reloaded during development, allowing you to see the updates immediately without losing your extension's state. The following files support HMR:

| Feature                  | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content scripts**      | JavaScript and CSS defined in `content_scripts` are hot-reloaded.               |
| **Background scripts**   | Background files are hot-reloaded, except for the service worker.               |
| **Injected scripts**     | Scripts injected into web pages via `scripting.executeScript` are hot-reloaded. |
| **HTML files**           | HTML pages in the `/pages` folder are hot-reloaded.                             |
| **Script files in HTML** | Scripts sourced from HTML pages are hot-reloaded.                               |
| **CSS files in HTML**    | Stylesheets linked in HTML pages are hot-reloaded.                              |

### Features That Require Hard Reload

Some parts of your extension cannot be hot-reloaded, and a hard reload is required. The following updates will trigger a full browser extension reload:

| Feature                      | Description                                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`manifest.json`**          | Any changes to the manifest file will trigger a full extension reload.                    |
| **Service worker**           | Updating the `service_worker.js` file requires a full reload by the extension runtime.    |
| **Locale files**             | Changes to localization files (inside `_locales`) also require a hard reload.             |
| **HTML/Scripts in manifest** | Any HTML, script, or CSS files referenced directly in the manifest require a full reload. |

## Reloading Scripts and HTML Outside the Manifest

Extension.js also supports hot-reloading for scripts and HTML files not declared in the `manifest.json`. HTML files placed in the `/pages` directory and script files in the `/scripts` directory can be hot-reloaded during development. This ensures that even extra files not listed in the manifest are processed and updated dynamically.

**Example:**

```plaintext
pages/
└── extra-page.html
scripts/
└── extra-script.js
```

> Note: The `/pages` and `/scripts` folders are special folders recognized by Extension.js for hot-reloading. Each entry in these folders is treated as a separate page or script that can be reloaded independently.

## Best Practices

- Avoid modifying the `manifest.json` frequently to prevent unnecessary full reloads.
- Use the `/pages` or `/scripts` folders for HTML and script files that need to be hot-reloaded and are not declared in the manifest.

## Next Steps

- Learn more about using special folders like `/pages` in the [Special Folders documentation](../features/special-folders.mdx).
